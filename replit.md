## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both the Express backend and Vite frontend on port 5000.

### Database Migrations
```bash
npm run db:push
```
Push schema changes to the PostgreSQL database.

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables (automatically set by Replit):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` - OpenAI API base URL
- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key

## Design System
The application follows a professional, productivity-focused design system with:
- **Typography:** Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Colors:** Blue primary (#3B82F6), professional neutrals
- **Spacing:** Consistent 4/6/8/12/16px scale
- **Components:** Shadcn UI components with custom styling
- **Interactions:** Subtle hover states and smooth transitions

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current MVP Limitations
1. WebSocket client not implemented on frontend (uses React Query polling instead)
2. No file upload/attachment support in chat
3. No voice input/output capabilities
4. No native mobile apps (web-only)
5. No Windows desktop application

### Planned Next Phase Features
1. Native mobile apps (iOS and Android)
2. Windows desktop application
3. File attachment support (infrastructure complete, UI integration pending)
4. Voice input/output
5. Advanced analytics dashboard
6. Team collaboration features
7. Calendar integration
8. Custom workflow automation
9. Full WebSocket real-time updates

## Production Considerations
- Database connection pooling is handled by Neon
- OpenAI API calls include error handling and graceful degradation
- React Query caching reduces API calls
- All secrets managed via Replit environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- CORS and security headers should be configured for production

## Testing
- End-to-end tests completed successfully
- All core user journeys verified:
  - Creating conversations and sending messages
  - Receiving AI responses
  - Creating and managing tasks
  - Creating and viewing knowledge entries
  - Theme toggling
  - Navigation between pages

## Support & Maintenance
- Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- Regular database backups recommended
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor error logs for AI service failures
